>  With all the force of youth he throws the gleaming golden fruit — obliquely, distantly — off course. The girl seemed hesitant — uncertain of her choice: to let it lie or pick it up. But I compelled her: she went off; she picked it up. So she lost time — and, too, the weight of three gold apples hampered her.

`melanion` is a pomodoro timer that performs its role through just the desktop environment's notification service and [`dunstify`](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/blob/master/dunstify.c).

It is designed to be flexibly (in)visible, and, when it must appear, gracefully emphatic.

Installation
----

To "install" `melanion`, simply `git clone` this repository into e.g. `/usr/local/bin`.

#### Dependencies

To install the `dunstify` dependency,

```bash
$ 
```

> Please note that only `dunstify` (the command utility) is depended upon, **not** `dunst` in full (which would replace or compete with your current notification daemon).
